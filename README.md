Pictures and descriptions of my Solidworks assignments.

## Design Tables
In this assignment, we made a design table which would provide a bunch of configurations for a spool. This would make it wider, have more screw holes, etc. It's pretty basic. One thing I had a bit of trouble with was accidentally jacking up the configurations because I didn't set changes to `This configuration` as opposed to `All configurations`. Dumb mistake, still happened though. Here's a picture of the various spool sizes, lined up.

## Advanced and Mechanical Mates
For this, we had to make this weird little thing.

The twist: it had to be able to extend, controlled by sliding the little pin in the middle. That wasn't a great way of describing it, so here's a picture. Warning: this picture is the epitome of comedy if you have the mind of a 3rd grader.

I had to make the three rectangle things and add configurations of them so that they fit together all nicely. I didn't have any issues with this ~~except when I was hecking stupid and forgot to turn off all configurations *again*~~. I then had to make the pin. Nothing really to say about that; I just put in the measurements given to me.

Now, for the interesting part. Up until now, I had never delved into the realm of what I called "wack mates". Remarkably eloquent, I know. But for this, we had to use `Width`, `Linear/Linear Coupler`, `Slot`, and `Tangent` mates (actually, `Tangent` is one of the standard mates, but whatever). The width one was to make the rectangle things inside of each other. From there, I used the linear mate to make them slide in and out of each other together, but at different rates. I then used the slot mate to put the pin inside its slot. Finally, I used a tangent mate to connect the pin to one of the rectangle things. This made it so that sliding one would slide the other. Done!

## Gears and Gearbox

Oh lord. This was a *time*.
